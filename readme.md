# 🌱 Welcome to My Github Portfolio

Hi! I’m Anissa — a data scientist, researcher, and founder deeply invested in building technologies that heal, empower, and transform. While I'm permanently locked out of my original GitHub of 5 years (RIP 😔), this new account will serve as my **living archive** of past work, current projects, and experiments in progress.

## 🚧 What's Here

This GitHub is in active reconstruction. Some are older projects I'm revamping make my current skillset; others are new research or tools I’m developing. Expect to find:
- **AI/ML models** — exploratory work in NLP, EDA, and Explainable AI
- **Data Viz** — data storytelling to make messy data beautiful and sensible to non-technical stakeholders
- **DeepYaad Tools** — software products that should exist in the world that my team is building

## 🔄 Current Status

I’m currently:
- Rebuilding my project archive here
- Applying for AI/ML research roles
- Completing research for Center for Emerging Markets in AI Product Development
